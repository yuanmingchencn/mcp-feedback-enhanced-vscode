# MCP Feedback Enhanced - Development Rules

## Code Style
- All code and comments must be in English
- Use TypeScript for extension code
- Use ESBuild for bundling
- Run `npm run compile` after modifications

## Architecture
- Extension acts as WebSocket server hub
- MCP server connects as client
- Webview connects as client
- State persists in extension process (wsServer.ts)

## Development Workflow
- Edit `scripts/generate-webview.js` for UI changes
- Run `npm run dev` for hot-reload during development
- See DEV_WORKFLOW.md for detailed architecture
